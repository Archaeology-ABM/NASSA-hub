## For developers

This website is rendered via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

To get a local working environment for easy development you can follow the steps outlined [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) and run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` for a dynamic preview of the website at http://127.0.0.1:4000. We recommend installing ruby through [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

The GitHub pages environment is simulated locally with [this gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) specifically written for this purpose.
