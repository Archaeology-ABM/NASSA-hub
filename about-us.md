# Who are we?

The **N**etwork for **A**gent-based modelling of **S**ocio-ecological **S**ystems in **A**rchaeology (**NASSA**) is a research network with the goal to gather an international, interdisciplinary group of researchers to collect and compile agent-based modelling (ABM) elements (implementation modules, techniques, approaches, etc.) and organise them as an open modelling library.

The targets of this network are:

1. identify and compile crucial modelling topics for the library;
2. collect and develop best practices and modelling guidelines;
3. develop tools for interoperability following the FAIR principles;
4. guarantee sustainability of the library;
5. create a structure for international collaboration resulting in joint publications within the network.
