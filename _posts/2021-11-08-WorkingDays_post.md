# Working Days
NASSA continues to fire on all engines. 
The network is hard at work to deliver a clear and concise infrastructure to the research community. 
Somehow, the different parties involved found two whole days to work on our backlog. Two! 
The picture below should be a clear indication of the level of enthusiasm (at the start of day one, that is). 
Visit again soon to admire our progress!<br><br>
