# NASSA module library is now on!

We are happy to finally close and release the first consolidated version of our library (v1.0.0)! This is in fact a very preliminary version but it should be enough to start feeding it up more submissions.

Repository: [https://github.com/Archaeology-ABM/NASSA-modules](https://github.com/Archaeology-ABM/NASSA-modules)

We are also working on materials such as instructions and tutorials to help both users and developers to better interact with the library. Meanwhile, we invite all to browse the modules published so far and perhaps consider if you have or know of any potential modules to submit.

The library is under development with much space for improvements. To help us with that, NASSA remains open feedback and new recruits.

Feel free to contact me ([Andreas Angourakis](https://github.com/Andros-Spica)) or any other NASSA member for more information!<br><br>
