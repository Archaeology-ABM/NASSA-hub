# Call for papers EAA 2022
The 2022 edition of the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting will once again feature a NASÂ²A-curated session.
The call for papers has just opened. And session #367, 'Agent-Based Modelling of Socio-Ecological Systems in Archaeology. Towards a New Research Community', is especially hungry for abstracts.
You can find the necessary details [here](https://www.e-a-a.org/EAA2022). <br><br> 
We wish you a festive holiday season and hope to see you in Budapest! <br><br>
