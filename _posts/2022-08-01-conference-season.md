# The (conference) season is upon us!

For many of us, the summer of 2022 heralded the resumption of international travel and conference attendance. While the Covid thread remained to loom large, with safety and health measures abound, the joy of connecting with old friends and meeting new ones was finally back. For NASSA as well, these marked the first real occasions to talk about our work with our peers and expand the network on conferences such as CAA, EAA, the CAA DE-NL-FL chapter, the 25 Challenges in ABM Workshop and the Spatial Archaeology workshop in Nice. We will report on our activities at these conferences in a series of small blog posts.
