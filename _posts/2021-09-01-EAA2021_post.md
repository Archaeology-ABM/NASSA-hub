# EAA 2021
NASSA had the pleasure of hosting a session at the European Association of Archaeologists' 27th Annual Meeting in Kiel, Germany. 
Several members seized the opportunity to share their work with the larger research community whilst simultaneously promoting the network.
You can find the programme [here](https://www.e-a-a.org/EAA2021/Programme.aspx?WebsiteKey=122bcc87-037e-4265-b72a-db2092c01854&hkey=f557022c-8526-45dd-b4ad-edaeb1c77ac8&Program=3#Program).<br><br>
We thank the organizers for this occasion and will definitely reappear on the roster in the future!<br><br>
