# NASSA at CAA 2022 Oxford

At the CAA 2022 annual meeting in Oxford, NASSA members organised [two sessions](https://archaeology-abm.github.io/NASSA-hub//2022/10/10/CAA2022_post.html). During the round-table session **"Towards an open platform for computer simulations of past socioecological systems"**, discussants have flipped the metaphorical table, inviting all in-person and online attendees to a live brainstorming session. But really, it was a perverse stratagem of ours to get ideas directly from the source!  

Using two interactive online tools, [wooclap](https://app.wooclap.com/) and [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/), we presented everyone with a few questions and gather answers live and digitally.

Here is a summary:

## Question 1: keywords/categories

> We're creating a library of modules, intended as bricks from which you can construct your model. But how to find the module that's right for you? If you were looking for a module to add to your ABM what kind of categories would you find useful? Write all that you can think of.

## Question 2: modules

> What kind of modules should each of these categories include? Use the dropdown menu to see the categories. If the model is already listed, press on the heart to vote for it. You can add as many suggestions as you want.
