# Guide for submission is now live!

After some much needed tuning and testing, the first complete version of our [Guide for submissions](https://archaeology-abm.github.io/NASSA-hub/guide) is now here. 

The guide walks through the entire workflow behind a successful module submission. We address the necessary steps in **Preparation**, including how to set up a GiHub account and your online or local copy of NASSA's library, **Creating a module**, from its code to the NASSA-specific metadata, and **Submitting a module**, including how to handle the automatic checks and review process. Check it out and submit a new module!

The Guide is of course still work in progress. A planned next-step will be to migrate the Guide to a separate repository and render it as a Quarto book instead of a single page, which would then make it easier to extend and update. Meanwhile, if you detect any issues or have any suggestions feel free to contact me ([Andreas Angourakis](https://github.com/Andros-Spica)).
